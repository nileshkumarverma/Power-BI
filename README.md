**Problem**:Suppose you work for Coca-Cola. You have been given a dataset which is in Excel format containing some financial information along with information like Retailer name, Invoice date, Region, State, City, etc. Create an interactive Power BI Dashboard for Coca-Cola.

**Solution**:

In this project, I have made a Power BI interactive dashboard from scratch on a made-up dataset for Coca-Cola. I have analyzed sales, profit margins, prices, regions, and more.
Here is an overview of the steps that I have followed to analyze the data and create the dashboard:
First, I have uploaded the dataset from Excel using Power Query.
Then, I made the dashboard structure by adding headers and shapes.
Thirdly, I worked on the following visuals:
**1.** The AI-powered: Q&A visual.
**2.** Key influencers visual in Power BI to analyze profit margins per brand.
**3.** Map chart to see sales by region.
**4.** Matrix to analyze financials such as price per unit and operating profit.
**5.** Dynamic timeline for users to change dates.
**6.** After creating the dashboard structure, I saved the project and exported it in PDF format.
